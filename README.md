==========

C++ implementations of miscellaneous algorithms

- Basic algorithms
    - [Factorial (recursive)](gcd_factorial.cpp)
    - [Greatest common divisor (GCD) with the Euclidean algorithm](gcd_factorial.cpp)
    - [Power (recursive)](power_sqrt.cpp)
    - [Square root with the Babylonian method (a.k.a. the Heron's method)](power_sqrt.cpp)
    - [Fibonacci number](hanoi_fibonacci.cpp)
    - [Tower of Hanoi](hanoi_fibonacci.cpp)

- [The knapsack problem](knapsack.cpp)
- [N queens problem (backtracking approach)](queens.cpp)

Implementations are written based on C++11 standard.

All the algorithms are accompanied with unit tests
